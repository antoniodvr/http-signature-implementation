# HTTP Signature

This authentication is based on [Http Signatures Internet-Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures-12).

This protocol extension is intended to provide a simple and standard way for clients to sign HTTP messages in order to ensure end-to-end message integrity.
